# Flutter Jobs App

## note : the app is not working now because of some changes in the web site and i will work on it soon(∞∞) but you can still benfit from the code in this repo 

 flutter job board app for Android/IOS using Flutter in this app a fetched the informations from the [flutter jobs website](https://flutterjobs.info/) and i tried to make everything custom from the **Drawer** to **Item** and it's a good example if you are trying to understand :
 * Web Scraping Using Dart
 * fetch data with authorization header
 * CustomPainter and CustomClipper 
 * Dismissible and RefreshIndicator 
 * Create Custom Drawer 
 * Show RefreshIndicator while Loading images
 * Transition animation like ScaleTransition
 * Keep widget alive and don't reload it all the time

# Thank _You_!
